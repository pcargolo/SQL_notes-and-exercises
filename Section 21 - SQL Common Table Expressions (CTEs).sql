-- Referring to CTEs in a WITH clause

# CTEs
## they are a tool providing temporary result sets that exist within the execution of a given query
## they are written in the WITH clause of a query
## a CTE can contain multicle subclauses (subqueries of the CTE)
## a CTE can be referenced multiple times within a query
## we can refer to a common table expressino defined earlier within a given WITH clause. We cannot refer to one that has been defined after.ALTER
